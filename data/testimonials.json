      "quote_zh": "這是我第一次參加的長距離團隊挑戰。在挑戰日前，我跟朋友分段走過該段路線熟習地形。然後去到當日，準備充足地展開挑戰。大部分時間都跟預想中一樣地進行，但也發生意料之外的事，例如冒牌熊事件，有驚又有喜。跟同伴一起完成的感覺很好，途中每次到達補給站見到朋友準備好食物、飲料跟椅子都覺得非常窩心、快樂。54km看似很長，但是完成後覺得整個過程都過得很快，難度不算高。很適合有興趣而怕完成不了的你挑戰一下自己。",
      "quote_en": "This was my first long-distance team challenge. Before challenge day, I hiked sections of the route with friends to familiarize myself with the terrain. On the day itself, we started well-prepared. Most things went as expected, but there were surprises too — like the fake bear incident, which was both scary and funny! Finishing together with teammates felt amazing. Every time we reached an aid station and saw friends with food, drinks, and chairs ready for us, it was heartwarming. 54km sounds long, but looking back, it flew by and wasn't as hard as I thought. Perfect for anyone interested but worried they can't finish — challenge yourself!",
